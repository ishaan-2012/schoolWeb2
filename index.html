          <p class="text-muted">This church was built on the school campus to allow the students and teachers to offer
            their prayers before starting the day. Everyone loved the ambience of the church and felt peaceful and safe
            inside the church building. Students were also encouraged to bring their family members to this church if
            they wanted to pray together. But this was only allowed on Sundays and not during the week when school was
            in session.</p>
